# Lending Club CaseStudy

#Problem statement

The case study analyses the loan past loan details for Lending Club company. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

#Goal
Analyse the loan detail history and give recommendations to the company to help take decision in lending loan to customers. The output should include recommendations backed by graphs for better visualization.
